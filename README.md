# Tableau - CITIBIKE ANALYSIS 2019

# Initial Thoughts

The data that I have used is from the CitiBike website and from February 2019. 

The story contains two dashboards to highlight two key phenomena.

I focused on gender as well as start and end station phenomena.

Depspite focusing on gender, the "unknown" gender was not removed.

not only does it form 48.79% of the customer data but it also tells me that repeated users (subscribers), are far more likely to input their gender information. Additionally, it is out of respect to the fact that not everyone will label themselves as "male" or "female".


The earliest year of birth for the riders was 1885, I would think it is fair to say from 1885 to approximately 1930 is just people inputting their DOB wrong. I have trouble believing that someone who is 138 years old is going on bike rides around New York City (but you never know). For this reason I have included a Year or Birth filter in slider format into my dashboard, so as not to discount the potential immortals living amongst us.
I have included hyperlinks into the dashboard that link to the original data source.
I chose the month Feburary from 3 different years pre-covid to determine if year on year there was an increase in usage.
