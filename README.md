# Tableau - CITIBIKE ANALYSIS 2019

# Initial Thoughts

The data that I have used is from the CitiBike website and from February 2019. 

The story contains two dashboards to highlight two key phenomena.

I focused on gender as well as start and end station phenomena.

Depspite focusing on gender, the "unknown" gender was not removed.

Repeated users (subscribers), are far more likely to input their gender information when compared to customers.

Furthermore, this could also be due to not everyone wanting to label themselves as 'male' or 'female'.

The earliest year of birth for the riders was 1874. which is unrealisitic and will most likely be due to people entering an incorrect DOB. 

I have included hyperlinks into the dashboard that link to the original data source.

I chose to use the data from February 2019 as this was just before covid would have a significant impact on our lives.

# Gender Analysis

Initially the first phenomena i noticed was that there were generally more male users than female users. There were approximately 66.28% and 21.78%. The large difference in the number of male and female users is due to females prefering not to cycle in areas with more traffic. 

The "unknown" gender has a higher percentage of customers than subscribers which is not the case for both males and females. 

# Analysis on Busiest periods 

The busiest periods for the Citibike program are from 7am till 10am which will most proabably be due to people commuting to and from work.

The busiest time and day for male cyclists is 5pm and Friday, whereas the busiest period in regards to time and day for females is 8am and Fridays respectively. I feel this is due to more females being more comfortable cycling in the day when it is light rather than later in the afternoon or evenings as it becomes darker. 

The Usertypes by Birth Year visualisation provides information on the ages of the people using the Citibike project and shows that the most common age for customers is 1969 and for subscribers it is 1990. This provides an insight that younger people are more likely to become subscribers. This could be due to them being more regular users for the Citibike scheme. 

# Busiest Stations and Maps

The busiest starting stations as shown in "Top 10 Starting Locations": 

* Pershing Square North which is located close to Grand Central Station which most likely plays a part in why it is the busiest. 

* W 21 St & 6th Ave which has many restaurants and retail shops located there.

* E 17 St & Broadway where the Union Square is lcoated. There is also the Union Green Markets there which will contirbute to the high numbers recorded in this region. 



The Map "Starting Station Locations and Count of Bikes" shows the number of cyclists starting their journeys at a sepcific station using the size of the circles to represent how busy these stations are. 

The Map "End Station Locations by Gender" represents the number of "male", "female" and "unknown" by colour. Noticebly, there are more males ending at locations in Jersey City as shown with the red dots on the map.
