# Tableau - CITIBIKE ANALYSIS 2019

# Initial Thoughts

The data that I have used is from the CitiBike website and from February 2019. 

The story contains two dashboards to highlight two key phenomena.

I focused on gender as well as start and end station phenomena.

Depspite focusing on gender, the "unknown" gender was not removed.

Repeated users (subscribers), are far more likely to input their gender information when compared to customers.

Furthermore, this could also be due to not everyone wanting to label themselves as 'male' or 'female'.

The earliest year of birth for the riders was 1874. which is unrealisitic and will most likely be due to people entering an incorrect DOB. 

I have included hyperlinks into the dashboard that link to the original data source.

I chose to use the data from February 2019 as this was just before covid would have a significant impact on our lives.

# Gender Analysis

Initially the first phenomena i noticed was that there were generally more male users than female users. There were approximately 66.28% and 21.78%. The large difference in the number of male and female users is due to females prefering not to cycle in areas with more traffic. 

The "unknown" gender has a higher percentage of customers than subscribers which is not the case for both males and females. 

# Analysis on Busiest periods 

The busiest periods for the Citibike program are from 7am till 10am which will most proabably be due to people commuting to and from work.

The busiest time and day for male cyclists is 5pm and Friday, whereas the busiest period in regards to time and day for females is 8am and Fridays respectively.
